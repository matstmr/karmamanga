                    Tanjirode travels southeast where he meets a young man named Zenitsu. He's another survivor of
                    the Final Selection and his sparrow ask Tanjiro to help him stay the course.

                    Together, Tanjiro and Zenitsu venture into a mountain and come face to face with a mansion.
                    mysterious. They meet Shoichi and Teruko, two young children whose brother was kidnapped and
                    taken into the house. They sometimes hear the southern sound of a drum, and it comes from a demon.

                    Tanjiro and Zenitsu enter the house but are separated soon after, tasked with protecting
                    each one of the children. Zenitsu meets a young demon slayer who wears a head of
                    boar as a mask. The boar Inosuke runs through the whole house to find the demon.

                    Inosuke and Tanjiro come to blows with the Drum Demon controlling the house. They are
                    eventually both transported while Zenitsu and Shoichi are chased all over the
                    home by the Tongue Demon. As he sleeps, Zenitsu shows off his incredible Breath abilities
                    of Lightning. We discover Inosuke's talents as a slayer.

                    Tanjiro and Teruko see Kiyoshi and learn that the demon wants to eat him at all costs because he
                    possesses "marechi blood". Tanjiro and Kyogai come face to face in a battle where
                    Kyogai constantly changes the orientation of the room using his Blood Power. Kyogai se
                    also reveals to be a former member of the Twelve Demon Moons.

                    spiders invading the forest.
                    These webs are indeed controlled by demons. Tanjiro and Inosuke manage to cooperate and
                    fight the mother of the spiders. Zenitsu, meanwhile, battles the Spider Clan Brother.
                    As the clan father manages to separate Tanjiro and Inosuke, Taniro comes across the creator of this
                    family named Rui, the latter engages in a fight against Nezuko and her brother. Tanjrio goes
                    develop new techniques as well as Nezuko.

                    It is then that they receive a letter from Sakonji, telling them not to take it out on him.
                    Giyu as well as Tanjiro because they were warned of the sentences if Nezuko managed to harm the
                    humans. Tanjiro trains to get stronger and learns new skills.

                    then awakens his bloodthirsty powers and envelops his body in flames which allows him to
